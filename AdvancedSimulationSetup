!!!Important: In this file, do not use the equal sign in a comment, as it triggers the reading of an input.

The units we use in the code are: length in millimeters (mm), mass in grams (g), and time in milliseconds (ms). 
Any value read from this file that is not in these units will be converted to these units in the code.

This value is how thick the wall of the LA is as a fraction of its radius. It will be used to find the tissue 
mass of the LA [?].

--WallThicknessFraction = 0.2;

The following values will be used to generate a force to mass ratio that will scale a muscle's strength by its mass.
Myocytes are approximately 120 micrometers (converting to our units 0.12 millimeters) in length [1].
Myocytes are approximately 10-15 micrometers (converting to our units 0.01-0.015 millimeters) in diameter [1].
The contraction force of a myocyte is about 10 micro-Newtons (converting to our 1e-5 g*mm/ms^2) [3].
Myocardial tissue density is about 1.055â€‰g/ml (converting to our units 0.001265 g/mm^3) [4].
A multiplier is added in case the user wants to scale this value; a value of 1.0 keeps it unchanged.
We also added a standard deviation in case the user wants to introduce some randomness to the muscle's 
strength; a value of 0.0 adds no randomness.
All five values should be floats.

--MyocyteLength = 0.12;
--MyocyteDiameter = 0.0125;
--MyocyteContractionForce = 1.0e-5;
--MyocardialTissueDensity = 0.001265;
--MyocyteForcePerMassMultiplier = 1.0;
--MyocyteForcePerMassSTD = 0.0;

Strength of the central push-back force, which is use to simulate blood pressure.
Left Atrial values are 2.0 mmHg for diastolic and 12.0 mmHg for systolic pressures [5].
We will convert to our units in the code.
We have added a multiplier so the user can scale the pressures as desired; a value of 1.0 keeps it unchanged.
All three values should be floats.

--DiastolicPressureLA = 2.0;
--SystolicPressureLA = 12.0;
--PressureMultiplier = 10.0;

To remove energy buildup in the system, we add a drag coefficient that works opposite to velocity.
This helps prevent the system from quivering and wandering around. A value around 1.0 works well.
It should be a float.

--Drag = 1.0;

The strength of a relaxed muscle is the opposite of the contraction force, helping return the muscle to its natural length.
This should be a small fraction of the contraction force.
It must be less than 1.0, or you will get a relaxed strength greater than the contraction strength.
It should be a float.

--MuscleRelaxedStrengthFraction = 0.2;

The fraction of a muscle's natural length after it contracts. 
A muscle should lose 30% of its length during contraction, so this value should be 0.7 [8]. 
We added a standard deviation in case the user would like to introduce some randomness into the simulation. 
Keep this number small. We suggest a value in the range of [0.0, 0.2]. 
Both should be floats

--MuscleCompresionStopFraction = 0.7;
--MuscleCompresionStopFractionSTD = 0.0;
