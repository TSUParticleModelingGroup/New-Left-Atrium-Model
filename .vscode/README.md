This workspace contains a recommended VS Code workspace settings file to make VS Code visually match a kitty terminal using the Catppuccin "Mocha" palette.

Quick notes:

- If you don't have the Catppuccin theme installed, install the "Catppuccin" theme extension from the Marketplace and select "Catppuccin Mocha" as the color theme.
- After installing the theme or changing settings, reload the window: `Developer: Reload Window` (Ctrl+Shift+P → type "Reload Window").
- The settings set the editor and integrated terminal background to the Catppuccin Mocha base, the terminal ANSI colors, and a monospace font to mimic kitty's appearance.

If you'd like VS Code to be even more minimal (hide activity bar, status bar, tabs), tell me and I can add workspace settings for that.
