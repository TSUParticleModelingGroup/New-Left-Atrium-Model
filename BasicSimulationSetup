!!!Important: In this file, do not use the equal sign in a comment, as it triggers the reading of an input.

The units we use in the code are: length in millimeters (mm), mass in grams (g), and time in milliseconds (ms). 
Any value read from this file that is not in these units will be converted to these units in the code.

Read from NodesMuscles file (0) or read from a previous run file (1).
Should be a 0 or a 1.

--NodesMusclesFileOrPreviousRunsFile = 0;

Name of the files that holds the nodes and muscles.

The code is not currently written for models with depth, but it does work with them. Use the 3D models with this in mind.

These are not closed objects, as long as you have muscle contractions turned off they can be used to study electrical activity.
If you turn muscle contraction on it will run but there is no center to simulate pressure from.

Place the Nodes and Muscle file you would like to run here.

--InputFileName = Rand200X200

Name of previous run files that were stored in GitHub.
Test

If you have made a previous run file and would like to run it, just place its name below. Also, this file will not 
be copied to GitHub, so you can build as many as you want without cluttering up the GitHub folder. If you have a good 
run that you want to share on GitHub for everyone to use, you will need to manually upload it to GitHub.
 
Place the name of the previous run file you would like to execute here.

--PreviousRunFileName = test1

Note: You will only read from a (nodes and muscle file) or a (previous run file), not both.

Connection line width for the lines that represent muscles connecting the nodes:
1.0 to 3.0 works well for simulations with many nodes, and 5.0 to 10.0 is suitable for simulations with fewer nodes.
It should be a float.
	
--LineWidth = 3.0;

Set the size of the node spheres here. It is scaled by the RadiusOfLeftAtrium. A good value is 0.01.
It should be a float.

--NodeRadiusAdjustment = 0.01;

If you want to turn off muscle contractions and just observe the electrical process, you can do so by setting this flag to 0.
1 (true) turns the muscle contraction on.
0 (false) turns the muscle contraction off. This will speed up the simulation if you are only studying the electrical action.
This can also be toggled on and off in the running simulation.
It should be a 0 or a 1.

--ContractionIsOn = 0;

Background color (Background of the scene): red, green, blue.
All three should be floats.

--BackGroundRed = 0.0;
--BackGroundGreen = 0.0;
--BackGroundBlue = 0.0;
