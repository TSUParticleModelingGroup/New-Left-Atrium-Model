Place the Nodes and Muscle file you would like to run here.

--InputFileName = IdealLeftAtrium2.3K

Name of previous run files that were stored in GitHub.
test1

If you have made a previous run file and would like to run it, just place its name below. Also, this file will not 
be copied to GitHub, so you can build as many as you want without cluttering up the GitHub folder. If you have a good 
run that you want to share on GitHub for everyone to use, you will need to manually upload it to GitHub.
 
Place the name of the previous run file you would like to execute here.

--PreviousRunFileName = test1

Note: You will only read from a (nodes and muscle file) or a (previous run file), not both.

Connection line width for the lines that represent muscles connecting the nodes:
1.0 to 3.0 works well for simulations with many nodes, and 5.0 to 10.0 is suitable for simulations with fewer nodes.
It should be a float.
	
--LineWidth = 3.0;

Set the size of the node spheres here. It is scaled by the RadiusOfLeftAtrium. A good value is 0.01.
It should be a float.

--NodeRadiusAdjustment = 0.01;

Calculating the myocyte force per mass ratio:
We will use this value to scale the contraction force of a muscle as a function of 
its mass. 
Myocytes are approximately 80-100 micrometers (0.08-0.1 millimeters) in length [1].
Myocytes are approximately 10-20 micrometers (0.01-0.02 millimeters) in width [2].
Treating the myocyte as a cylinder with a length of 0.09 mm and a diameter of 0.015 mm, 
we get a volume of: pi*((0.015/2)^2)*0.09 mm^3 (0.00001590431281 mm^3).
The clinically accepted value for myocardial tissue density is 1.055â€‰g/ml [3].
This gives the mass of a myocyte as 1.6779E-8 grams.
The contraction force of a myocyte is about 10 micro-Newtons (1e-5 g*mm/ms^2) [4].
Putting this together, the force per unit mass of a myocyte is 596 mm/ms^2.
A multiplier is added in case the user wants to scale this value; a value of 1.0 keeps it unchanged.
We also added a standard deviation in case the user wants to introduce some randomness to the muscle's 
behavior; a value of 0.0 adds no randomness.
All three should be floats.

--MyocyteForcePerMass = 596.0;
--MyocyteForcePerMassMultiplier = 1.0;
--MyocyteForcePerMassSTD = 0.0;

Calculating the strength of the central push-back force, which we use to simulate blood pressure:
1 millimeter of mercury is 133.322387415 Pascals or kg/(meters*seconds*seconds).
Converting this into our units of grams, milliseconds, and millimeters gives 0.000133322387415.
Therefore, 1 millimeter of mercury is equivalent to 0.000133322387415 in our units of g/(mm*ms*ms).
Here, simply enter the pressure in the left atrium in millimeters of mercury, and we will adjust the 
units in the code. 
Good starting values are 2.0 mmHg for diastolic and 12.0 mmHg for systolic pressure [5].
We have added a multiplier so the user can scale the pressures as desired; a value of 1.0 keeps it unchanged.
All three values should be floats.

--DiastolicPressureLA = 2.0;
--SystolicPressureLA = 12.0;
--PressureMultiplier = 10.0;

This is the mass of the left atrium that will be using.
A good value for the left atrium is 25 grams [6].
It should be a float.
 
--MassOfLeftAtrium = 25.0;

Calculating the average radius of the left atrium: 
The left atrium holds around 23640 cubic millimeters of blood [7]. 
Using volume to be PI*(4/3) radius^3 we get 17.8 millimeters.
It should be a float.

--RadiusOfLeftAtrium = 17.8;

To remove energy buildup in the system, we add a drag coefficient that works opposite to velocity.
This helps prevent the system from quivering and wandering around. A value around 1.0 works well.
It should be a float.

--Drag = 1.0;

************************************************************

If you want to turn off muscle contractions and just watch the electrical process you do that by setting 
this flag to 0.
1 (true) turns the muscle contraction on.
0 (false) turns the muscle contraction off. This will speed the simulation up if you are just studing the electrical action.
It should be a 0 or a 1.

--ContractionIsOn = 1;

The strength of a relaxed muscle. It is opposite the contraction force to help return the muscle to its natural length. 
This should be a small fraction of the contraction force.
It must be less than 1.0 or you will get a relaxed strength greater than your contraction strength.
It should be a float.

--MuscleRelaxedStrengthFraction = 0.2;

The fraction of a muscles natural length once it is contracted. 
A muscle should lose 30% of its length during contraction so this should be 0.7 [8].
We added a standard deviation incase the use would like to add a little stocasity to the simulation.
Keep this number small. We suggest a number in (0.0, 0.2).
Both should be floats.

--MuscleCompresionStopFraction = 0.7;
--MuscleCompresionStopFractionSTD = 0.0;

The length of time a muscle is contracting and relaxing. 
A standard value is around 300 milliseconds [9].
We added a standard deviation incase the use would like to add a little stocasity to the simulation.
We suggest a number in (0.0, 100.0).
Both should be floats.

--BaseMusclerRefractoryPeriod = 300.0;
--MuscleRefractoryPeriodSTD = 0.0;

This is the portion of the refractory period that is absolute. A standard value is 0.9 [10].
The relative refractory period will be what is left over and will be calculated in the code.
We added a standard deviation incase the use would like to add a little stocasity to the simulation.
Keep this number small. We suggest a number in (0.0, 0.1).
Both should be floats.

--AbsoluteRefractoryPeriodFraction = 0.9;
--AbsoluteRefractoryPeriodFractionSTD = 0.0;

The speed of the conduction velocity across a muscle. 
This will scaled by the muscle length to get the time it takes to cross a muscle.
This should be around 0.5 millimeters/milliseconds [11].
We added a standard deviation incase the use would like to add a little stocasity to the simulation.
Keep this number small. We suggest a number in (0.0, 0.1).
Both should be floats.

--BaseMuscleConductionVelocity = 0.5;
--MuscleConductionVelocitySTD = 0.0;

The length of time between heart beats. 
A 1000 milliseconds is 60 beats per minute.
Should be a float.

--BeatPeriod = 600.0;

How often you update the terminal, in milliseconds.
Should be a float.

--PrintRate = 100.0;

How often you update the picture of the simulation to the screen. This is in iterations not time.
Should be an int.

--DrawRate = 1000;

Your time step 0.0001 to 0.001 or whatever is the fraction of a time unit in each iteration.
Should be a float.

-- Dt = 0.001;

Ready color red, green, blue.
All three should be floats.

--ReadyRed = 1.0;
--ReadyGreen = 0.0;
--ReadyBlue = 0.0;

Contracting color red, green, blue.
All three should be floats.

--ContractingRed = 1.0;
--ContractingGreen = 1.0;
--ContractingBlue = 0.0;

Resting (second portion of the absolute refractory period 
contracting color took up the first part) color red, green, blue.
All three should be floats.

--RestingRed = 0.5451;
--RestingGreen = 0.2706;
--RestingBlue = 0.0745;

Relative Refractory Period color red, green, blue.
All three should be floats.

--RelativeRed = 1.0;
--RelativeGreen = 0.0784;
--RelativeBlue = 0.5765;

Dead color red, green, blue.
All three should be floats.

--DeadRed = 1.0;
--DeadGreen = 1.0;
- = 1.0;

Background color red, green, blue.
All three should be floats.

--BackGroundRed = 0.0;
--BackGroundGreen = 0.0;
--BackGroundBlue = 0.0;
