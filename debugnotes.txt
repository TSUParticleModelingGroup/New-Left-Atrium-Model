Observations based on newGL test and SVT simulations:

GLFW is not slowing the simulation down
GLFW works perfectly fine parallelized and with 2.3k nodes

Both Circle24 and IdealLeftAtrium2.3k run slow, weirdly enough idealLA2.3k draws more often?

Running on Circle24 confirms that the draw rate is significantly slower... why?

Simulation slows down to about the same draw speed as SVT at ~50k spheres

Putting all of this together, my guess is that this is due to some sort of CPU/GPU bottleneck within the code
    Possible solution: Optimization, shorten amnt of mem copies, use VBOs
