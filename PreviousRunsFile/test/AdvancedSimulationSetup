!!!Important: In this file, do not use the equal sign in a comment, as it triggers the reading of an input.

The units we use in the code are: length in millimeters (mm), mass in grams (g), and time in milliseconds (ms). 
Any value read from this file that is not in these units will be converted to these units in the code.

This value is how thick the wall of the LA is as a fraction of its radius. It will be used to find the tissue 
mass of the LA [A0]. 

--WallThicknessFraction = 0.16;

The following values will be used to generate a force to mass ratio that will scale a muscle's strength by its mass.
Myocytes are approximately 120 micrometers (converting to our units 0.12 millimeters) in length [A1].
Myocytes are approximately 10-15 micrometers (converting to our units 0.01-0.015 millimeters) in diameter [A1].
The contraction force of a myocyte is about 10 micro-Newtons (converting to our 1e-5 g*mm/ms^2) [A2].
The clinically accepted value of cardial tissue density is about 1.055 g/ml (converting to our units 0.001265 g/mm^3) [A3].
A multiplier is added in case the user wants to scale this value; a value of 1.0 keeps it unchanged.
We also added a standard deviation in case the user wants to introduce some randomness to the muscle's 
strength; a value of 0.0 adds no randomness.
All five values should be floats.

--MyocyteLength = 0.12;
--MyocyteDiameter = 0.0125;
--MyocyteContractionForce = 1.0e-5;
--MyocardialTissueDensity = 0.001265;
--MyocyteForcePerMassMultiplier = 1.0;
--MyocyteForcePerMassSTD = 0.0;

Strength of the central push-back force, which is use to simulate blood pressure.
Left Atrial values are 2.0 mmHg for diastolic and 12.0 mmHg for systolic pressures [A4].
We will convert to our units in the code.
We have added a multiplier so the user can scale the pressures as desired; a value of 1.0 keeps it unchanged.
All three values should be floats.

--DiastolicPressureLA = 2.0;
--SystolicPressureLA = 12.0;
--PressureMultiplier = 10.0;

To remove energy buildup in the system, we add a drag coefficient that works opposite to velocity.
This helps prevent the system from quivering and wandering around. A value around 1.0 works well.
It should be a float.

--Drag = 5.0;

The strength of a relaxed muscle is the opposite of the contraction force, helping return the muscle to its natural length.
This should be a small fraction of the contraction force.
It must be less than 1.0, or you will get a relaxed strength greater than the contraction strength.
It should be a float.

--MuscleRelaxedStrengthFraction = 0.2;

The fraction of a muscle's natural length after it contracts. 
A cardiac muscle should lose 10% of its length during contraction, so this value should be 0.9 [A5].
A skeletal muscle should lose 30% of its length during contraction.
0.9 is kind of too small to see and you need to us a dt of less than 0.001 or it blows up. Need to look into this. ???
We added a standard deviation in case the user would like to introduce some randomness into the simulation. 
Keep this number small. We suggest a value in the range of [0.0, 0.2]. 
Both should be floats

--MuscleCompresionStopFraction = 0.7;
--MuscleCompresionStopFractionSTD = 0.0;

A0) For an average LA the diameter is around 37 mm and its average wall thickness is around 2.0 mm. This gives a a wall thickness/ diameter 
	2.0/18.5 ~ 0.11. This gives a mass of a normal heart of around 12.5 grams with the density given below. I was exspecting about 20 grams
	with the appendage removed. With this being low use maybe 1.6 and adDress this in more detail when we have time. ???

A5) It seems like it could be less than 10%. From the graph in this paper it looks like for humans it is 5%. We will use 30% for effect.
	If you use 10% you may need to reduce your dt to keep the simulation from getting numeric overflow.
	When we add blood to the model we need to readdress this.
