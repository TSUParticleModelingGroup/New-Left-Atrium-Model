Place the Nodes and Mucsle file you would like to run here.
InputFileName = IdealLeftAtrium13.0KNotTriangle

Place the name of the previuos run file you would like to run here.
PreviousRunFileName = test

Note: you will only read from a (nodes and muscle file) or from a (previuos run file) not both.


Connection width for for the lines that represent muscles connecting the nodes. 
1.0 to 3.0 looks good for spheres and 5.0 to 10.0 for circles. (float)	
LineWidth = 4.0;

Set the size of the node sphere here. It is scaled by the RadiusOfAtria a good value is 0.01.

What we are using for the mass of a myocyte. Myocytes are approximately 80-100 micrometers or 0.08-.1 millimeters in length
and 10-20 micrometers or 0.01-0.02 millimeters in width (Chapter 12 - Cardiovascular and Skeletal Muscle Systems
Author links open overlay panelWanda M.HaschekColin G.RousseauxMatthew A.Wallig). Treating the myocyte as a cylinder with length 0.09 mm and diameter 0.015 mm
you get a volume of pi*((0.015/2)^2)*0.09 which is 0.00001590431281 mm^3. 
The clinically accepted value of myocardial tissue density is 1.055â€‰g/ml (https://bmcmedimaging.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12880-019-0326-4).
This gives the mass of a myocyte as 1.6779E-8 grams
The contraction force of myocyte is about 10 micro Newtons (not sure where Avery got this need to site it.) This 1e-5 g*mm/ms^2.
This gives force per mass of a myocyte as 596 mm/ms^2. I will use this to scale the contraction force of our muscles. (float)
MyocyteForcePerMass = 596.0;

This will be the strength of the central push back force which will simulate blood pressure.
Our units for pressure are grams/(Millimeters*(Millisecons^2)).
1 millimeters of mercury is 133.322387415 Pascals which is in kg/(meters*seconds*seconds).
Putting this into our units of grams, milliseconds, millimeters gives 0.01333224.
So 1 millimeter of Mercury is 0.000133322387415 in our units of g/(mm*ms*ms)
Here just enter the pressure in the left or right atrium in millimeters of Mercury and we will fix the units in the code.
To get the force on the node we will need an area to multiply the pressure by.
We used a circle of half the average distance to all the connected nodes as the area.
You are losing some area so we divided the lost area proportionally amount the nodes by (area of node)/(total area of sphere).
A reasonable pressure for the right Atrium is 5 millimeterrs of mercury and for the left is 8 millimeterrs of mercury.
BloodPressure = 80.0;

A good mass for the Left atria is 25 grams and a good mass for the right atrium is 22 grams. (float) 
MassOfAtria = 25.0;

This should be the radius of the atria. The atria holds around 23640 cubic millimeters of blood which gives a radius of 17.8 millimeters. (float) 
RadiusOfAtria = 17.8;

The strength of a relaxed muscle. Probably zero but I gave it a little strength to help it return to its natural length. 
This will be multiplied by the muscle mass to scale it. This should be much less than contraction force.
I will check it in the code and kill the program if it is greater than the contraction strength (10.0). (float)
BaseMuscleRelaxedStrength = 2.0;

The fraction of a muscles natural length once it is contracted. 
We think it will lose 30% of its length so this should be 0.7. (float)
BaseMuscleCompresionStopFraction = 0.7;

The length of time a muscle is contracted. 
We think this should be around 200 milliseconds. (float)
BaseMuscleContractionDuration = 100.0;
20.0 works well

The length of time a muscle must relaxed before it can contract again. 
We think this should be around 200 milliseconds. (float)
BaseMuscleRechargeDuration = 100.0;
20.0 works well

The speed of the conduction velocity across a muscle. 
This will scaled by the muscle length to get the time it takes to cross a muscle.
We think this should be around 0.5 millimeters/milliseconds. (float) (0.00125 for micro)
BaseMuscleActionPotentialSpeed = 0.5;
0.05 works well

The number of ectopic periodic events allowed. The first ectopic period will be the sinus beat.
MaxNumberOfperiodicEctopicEvents = 50;

The length of time between heart beats. 
A 1000 milliseconds is 60 beats per minute. (float)
BeatPeriod = 500.0;

How often you print the time to the terminal, in milliseconds. (float)
PrintRate = 100.0;

How often you draw to the screen. How many iterations are run between draws. (int)
DrawRate = 1000;

Your time step 0.0001 to 0.001 or whatever is the fraction of a time unit in each iteration. (float)
