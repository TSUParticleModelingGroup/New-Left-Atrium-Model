To load a model from blender:

Select all
File > Export > Export as .stl

It is best to create a directory for your model and drop the STL file in the directory:

mkdir /NodesMuscles/NewModel
mv NewModel.stl /NodesMuscles/NewModel

then run something along the lines of this command:
python MakeNodesAndMuscleFiles/stl_to_nodes.py path/to/model.stl


It will create a nodes and muscles file with default types and headers for use in the model config and model.
