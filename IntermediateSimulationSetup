!!!Important: In this file, do not use the equal sign in a comment, as it triggers the reading of an input.

The units we use in the code are: length in millimeters (mm), mass in grams (g), and time in milliseconds (ms). 
Any value read from this file that is not in these units will be converted to these units in the code.

The length of the left atrium's refractory period. 
A standard value is around 300 milliseconds [9]. 
We added a standard deviation in case the user would like to introduce some randomness to the simulation. 
We suggest a value in the range of [0.0, 100.0]. Both should be floats.

--BaseMusclerRefractoryPeriod = 300.0;
--MuscleRefractoryPeriodSTD = 0.0;

This is the portion of the refractory period that is absolute. 
A standard value is 0.9 [10]. 
The relative refractory period will be what is left over and will be calculated in the code. 
We added a standard deviation in case the user would like to introduce some randomness to the simulation. 
Keep this number small. We suggest a value in the range of [0.0, 0.1]. 
Both should be floats.

--AbsoluteRefractoryPeriodFraction = 0.9;
--AbsoluteRefractoryPeriodFractionSTD = 0.0;

The speed of the conduction velocity across a muscle. 
This will be scaled by the muscle length to get the time it takes an impulse to travel across the muscle. 
This should be around 0.5 millimeters/millisecond [11]. 
We added a standard deviation in case the user would like to introduce some randomness to the simulation. 
Keep this number small. We suggest a value in the range of [0.0, 0.1]. 
Both should be floats.

--BaseMuscleConductionVelocity = 0.5;
--MuscleConductionVelocitySTD = 0.0;

This is a multiplier that adjusts the conduction velocity through a Bachmann's Bundle muscle.
I have no idea what this should be so at the moment we will set it to 2.0 (ie twice as fast).
We need to look this up and site it [12]

-- BachmannsBundleMultiplier = 5.0; 

The length of time between heart beats. 
A 1000 milliseconds is 60 beats per minute.
Should be a float.

--BeatPeriod = 600.0;

How often you update the terminal, in milliseconds.
Should be a float.

--PrintRate = 100.0;

How often you update the picture of the simulation to the screen. This is in iterations not time.
Should be an int.

--DrawRate = 250;

Your time step, the fraction of the time unit for each iteration. 
We suggest a value between 0.0001 and 0.001. 
It should be a float.

-- Dt = 0.001;

Ready color. Where the muscle is rested and ready to contract: red, green, blue.
All three should be floats.

--ReadyRed = 1.0;
--ReadyGreen = 0.0;
--ReadyBlue = 0.0;

Depolarization color: red, green, blue.
All three should be floats.

--ContractingRed = 1.0;
--ContractingGreen = 1.0;
--ContractingBlue = 0.0;

Repolarization color (second portion of the absolute refractory period 
Depolarization color took up the first part) color: red, green, blue.
All three should be floats.

--RestingRed = 0.5451;
--RestingGreen = 0.2706;
--RestingBlue = 0.0745;

Relative Refractory Period color (Where the muscle can depolarization but it usually does not): red, green, blue.
All three should be floats.

--RelativeRed = 1.0;
--RelativeGreen = 0.0784;
--RelativeBlue = 0.5765;

Dead color (If a node is ablated or something went wrong in a muscle it is this color): red, green, blue.
All three should be floats.

--DeadRed = 1.0;
--DeadGreen = 1.0;
--DeadBlue = 1.0;
